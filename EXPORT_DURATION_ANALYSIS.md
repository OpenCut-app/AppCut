# Export Duration Analysis - Short Summary

## Root Cause Identified ‚ùå
**Bug in `calculateActualVideoDuration()` method** (export-engine.ts:344-363)

### The Problem
Line 354-355 incorrectly calculates element duration:
```typescript
const effectiveDuration = mediaItem.duration - trimStart - trimEnd;
const elementEndTime = (element.startTime || 0) + effectiveDuration;
```

This double-applies duration calculations since timeline elements already have correct `duration` property.

## What's Working ‚úÖ
- Timeline duration calculation (timeline-store.ts)
- Frame rendering and video seeking
- Export process flow
- Video recording functionality

## The Fix üîß
Replace the buggy calculation with:
```typescript
const elementEndTime = (element.startTime || 0) + element.duration;
```

Timeline elements already have the correct duration accounting for trims.

## Next Steps
1. **Fix the `calculateActualVideoDuration()` method**
2. **Test export with corrected duration calculation**
3. **Verify export reaches expected 5.083s duration**
