# Export Duration Analysis - Critical Finding

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED: Debug Logs Missing

### What I Found
Added comprehensive debug logging to export initialization (lines 107-191 in export-engine.ts), but **NONE of the debug logs appear in the console output**.

### The Missing Debug Output
The following debug sections should appear but are completely absent:
```
üöÄ EXPORT INITIALIZATION DEBUG:
üìä DETAILED TIMELINE ELEMENTS ANALYSIS:
üé• MEDIA ITEMS DURATION ANALYSIS:
‚è±Ô∏è DURATION COMPARISON:
üõ†Ô∏è DURATION ADJUSTMENT DETECTED! (or ‚úÖ No adjustment needed)
```

### What This Reveals
**The export initialization code (lines 105-195) is NOT running at all.**

## üîç Current Export Flow Analysis

From the visible logs, the export process goes directly to:
1. Frame rendering loop starts immediately
2. Frame 76-91 get rendered (2.5s to 3.033s)
3. Export stops at frame 91 with "All frames rendered"

**This means**: The export engine is using a pre-calculated duration of 3.033s without running the initialization debug code.

## üéØ Root Cause Hypothesis

### Most Likely: Export Method Bypass
The export is NOT going through the main `async export()` method that contains all the debug logging. 

**Possible scenarios:**
1. **Different export entry point** - Another method is being called
2. **Cached export configuration** - Using pre-configured FrameCaptureService
3. **Previous export state** - Export engine reusing old configuration
4. **Alternative export path** - Different code path for certain export modes

### Evidence Supporting This Theory
- ‚úÖ Debug logs completely missing (initialization code not executed)
- ‚úÖ Frame rendering starts immediately at frame 76 (not frame 0)
- ‚úÖ Export duration already set to 3.033s (91 frames √∑ 30fps = 3.033s)
- ‚úÖ No "Export starting" or preflight check logs

## üîß Next Investigation Steps

### 1. Find the Actual Export Entry Point
Search for which method is actually being called:
- Is it `export()` method?
- Is it `exportWithFFmpeg()`?
- Is it some other export method?

### 2. Check for Export Mode Configuration
The app might be using:
- MediaRecorder export (default)
- FFmpeg offline export (`NEXT_PUBLIC_OFFLINE_EXPORT=true`)
- Different export modes have different code paths

### 3. Verify Export Engine Instance State
The export engine might be:
- Reusing previous configuration
- Pre-initialized with wrong duration
- Using cached FrameCaptureService

## üé™ Working Theory
**The 3.033s duration is being set BEFORE the export method we debugged is even called.**

The export engine is either:
1. Pre-configured with `duration: 3.033` in the constructor
2. Using a different export method entirely
3. Reusing cached export configuration

**Next Action**: Find which export method is actually being invoked and why the initialization debug code is being bypassed.
