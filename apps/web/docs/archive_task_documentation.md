# Archive Task Documentation: `archive_task/`

This directory serves as an archive for various Markdown documents related to past tasks, bug reports, feature analyses, and development plans within the OpenCut project. These documents provide historical context, insights into resolved issues, and records of design decisions.

## Overview

The `archive_task/` directory is a collection of detailed notes and reports, primarily in Markdown format. It acts as a knowledge base for specific development efforts, debugging sessions, and feature implementations that have been completed or are no longer actively being worked on. The files often contain logs, analysis, and plans that were crucial at a certain point in the project's lifecycle.
