# Task 15: Electron Renderer Debug Analysis

## Issue Summary
Electron renderer debugging output showing component hydration and visibility issues.

## Key Findings

### Electron Environment Detection
- `window.electronAPI` detected and available
- Body has `data-electron` attribute set to `true`
- Electron visibility fixes applied successfully

### Component Rendering Issues
- **React/ReactDOM**: Both showing as `undefined` 
- **Hero Components**: 
  - Hero text (h1) found: `true`
  - Hero button found: `true` 
  - Hero form found: `false`
- **Hero Text Styles**: Opacity set to 1, visibility visible, display block

### Button Analysis
- Total buttons found: 3
- Button details captured with extensive CSS class information
- Two main buttons identified:
  1. "Select Projects" button with complex styling
  2. "New project" button with similar styling patterns

### Hydration Debug
- Hydration debug checks initiated with delay
- No React Fiber found during hydration check
- Suggests potential React hydration timing issues

## Technical Context
This appears to be debugging output from an Electron app with Next.js, investigating why certain UI components may not be rendering or hydrating properly in the Electron environment.
