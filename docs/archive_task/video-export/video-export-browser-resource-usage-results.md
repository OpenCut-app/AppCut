2. **Thermal Protection**:
   ```javascript
   // Add thermal throttling detection
   const thermalMonitor = {
     performanceBaseline: measureBaseline(),
     degradationThreshold: 10, // 10% degradation triggers throttling
     cooldownPeriod: 5000 // 5 second cooldown
   };
   ```

3. **Progressive Processing**:
   ```javascript
   // Break intensive operations into chunks
   const processInChunks = async (data, chunkSize = 1000) => {
     for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += chunkSize) {
       await processChunk(data.slice(i, i + chunkSize));
       await throttleIfNeeded(); // Check thermal status
