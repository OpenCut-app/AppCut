# Legacy Debug Scripts - Completed Task ✅

These debug scripts were used during the initial Electron desktop application development phase to troubleshoot various issues that have since been resolved.

## Scripts Moved (January 2025):

### Path Fixing Scripts:
- `fix-electron-next-data.js` - Fixed __NEXT_DATA__ script paths
- `fix-electron-paths-simple.js` - Basic asset path corrections
- `fix-electron-static-paths.js` - Static file path resolution
- `electron-path-fixer-*.js` - Various path fixing utilities

### Navigation & UI Debug Scripts:
- `button-click-test.js` - New Project button functionality testing
- `electron-new-project-button-test.js` - Project creation navigation
- `electron-projects-navigation-test.js` - Page navigation debugging
- `simple-nav-test.js` - Basic navigation testing

### React & Hydration Debug Scripts:
- `debug-react-hydration.js` - SSR hydration issue debugging
- `electron-react-hydration-analyzer.js` - React state analysis
- `electron-react-startup-debug-test.js` - React initialization debugging

### General Debug Utilities:
- `console-button-debug.js` - Button interaction logging
- `debug-simple-console.js` - Basic console debugging
- `electron-general-debug-script.js` - Comprehensive debugging utility
- `electron-runtime-debug-injector.js` - Runtime debug injection

### System Scripts:
- `run-electron-app-with-reset.bat` - Windows app launcher with reset
- `run-electron-test-nav.bat` - Navigation testing launcher

## Issues Resolved:

✅ **Electron Path Resolution**: All asset paths now resolve correctly through proper build pipeline
✅ **React Hydration**: SSR/hydration issues fixed in components and routing
✅ **Navigation Issues**: Project creation and page navigation working properly  
✅ **UI Visibility**: All Electron-specific rendering issues resolved
✅ **Build Process**: Complete Electron build and packaging pipeline working

## Current Status:

These scripts are **no longer needed** as all the issues they were created to debug have been permanently fixed through:

1. **Proper Build Scripts**: `apps/web/scripts/` directory contains production-ready build utilities
2. **Component Fixes**: React components properly handle Electron environment
3. **Configuration Updates**: Electron main process and preload scripts properly configured
4. **Path Resolution**: Asset paths correctly resolved through Next.js build process

## Recommendation:

These files can be safely deleted after a reasonable archive period, as they represent completed debugging work rather than ongoing utilities.
