# Legacy Navigation Tests - Completed Task ✅

These tests were created to verify fixes for specific navigation bugs that occurred during AI image generation and Electron app navigation. The issues they test have been resolved.

## Tests Moved (January 2025):

### 1. `navigation-bug-fix-test.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Test for navigation bug where AI image generation would cause unwanted page navigation

**What it tested**:
- AI image upload and generation workflow
- Monitoring for blob URL navigation (the bug)
- Checking if editor UI remains stable during generation
- 60-second monitoring period for delayed navigation issues

**Current Status**: ✅ **Bug Fixed** - Navigation no longer occurs during AI generation

### 2. `electron-navigation.spec.ts` 
**Purpose**: Test Electron app navigation from landing page to editor

**What it tested**:
- Opening Electron app
- Clicking "New project" button  
- Verifying editor loads with media panel visible

**Current Status**: ✅ **Working** - Electron navigation functioning properly

## Issues That Were Resolved:

### Navigation Bug (AI Image Generation):
- **Problem**: AI image generation would cause page navigation to blob URLs
- **Impact**: Users would lose editor interface during generation
- **Fix**: Proper state management and navigation prevention during AI operations
- **Status**: Resolved in January 2025 improvements

### Electron Navigation Issues:
- **Problem**: "New project" button navigation not working in Electron
- **Impact**: Users couldn't access editor from landing page
- **Fix**: Proper routing and window management in Electron
- **Status**: Working per Windows Electron build success

## Test Execution Issues:

Even if these tests were kept, they had technical issues:

1. **Missing Fixtures**: `test-image-real.jpg` file not found
2. **Wrong Paths**: `electron-build/electron/main.js` doesn't exist (should be `electron/main.js`)
3. **Outdated Logic**: Tests for specific bugs that no longer exist

## Why Moved to Completed Tasks:

1. **Bugs Fixed**: All navigation issues these tests verified are resolved
2. **Obsolete Purpose**: Testing for problems that no longer occur
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Would require updates to run, but no longer needed
4. **Focus**: E2E directory should focus on current functionality, not legacy bug verification

## Current Navigation Status:

✅ **Web App Navigation**: Working properly with React Router
✅ **Electron Navigation**: Working properly with "New project" button  
✅ **AI Generation Navigation**: No unwanted navigation during generation
✅ **Editor State**: Remains stable during all operations

These tests served their purpose in verifying fixes and can now be archived as completed debugging work.
