# Test Asset Generators - Completed Task ✅

These JavaScript scripts were used to generate test assets (images and videos) for E2E testing. The assets have been created and the generators are no longer needed.

## Files Moved (January 2025):

### Asset Generation Scripts:
- `test-asset-generators.js` (formerly `create-test-image.js`) - Generated BMP and JPEG test images
- `create-test-video.js` - Video file generation script

## What They Created:

### Test Images Generated:
- **`test-image.bmp`**: 100x100 red square BMP file
- **`test-image.jpg`**: JPEG version using data URL conversion
- **Purpose**: Provide consistent test images for upload/processing tests

### Test Videos Generated:
- Basic video files for testing video upload and processing workflows
- Various formats and sizes for comprehensive testing

## Current Status:

### ✅ **Assets Already Created**:
The generated test assets exist in the fixtures directory:
- `test-image-real.jpg` - Real test image for comprehensive testing
- `test-image.jpg` - Generated JPEG test image  
- `test-image.bmp` - Generated BMP test image

### ✅ **Generators No Longer Needed**:
These were one-time utility scripts to create test assets. Now that the assets exist, the generators can be archived.

## Why Moved to Completed Tasks:

1. **Purpose Fulfilled**: Assets have been generated and are available
2. **One-Time Use**: These were utility scripts, not ongoing test infrastructure
3. **Maintenance**: No need to maintain asset generation code
4. **Focus**: E2E fixtures should contain test utilities, not asset generators

## Current E2E Fixtures (Kept):

### ✅ **Active Test Infrastructure**:
- `test-utils.ts` - Test file creation utilities (actively used)
- `test-data.ts` - Mock data and test scenarios  
- `page-objects.ts` - Page Object Models for test maintainability
- Test image assets - Required for upload testing

### Value for Future Reference:
These generator scripts document how test assets were created and could be referenced if:
- Additional test assets are needed
- Asset recreation is required
- Similar asset generation is needed for other projects

The test assets they generated remain as valuable fixtures for E2E testing.
