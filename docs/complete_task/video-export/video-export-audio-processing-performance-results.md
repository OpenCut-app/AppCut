     for (let i = 0; i < audioData.length; i += bufferSize) {
       processChunk(audioData.slice(i, i + bufferSize));
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Track Management**:
   ```javascript
   // Optimize for multiple tracks
   const MAX_CONCURRENT_TRACKS = 16;
   const trackProcessor = new AudioTrackProcessor({
     maxTracks: MAX_CONCURRENT_TRACKS,
