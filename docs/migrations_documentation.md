# Migrations Documentation: `apps/web/migrations/`

This document provides an overview of the database migration files located in the `apps/web/migrations/` directory. These files are used to manage changes to the application's database schema over time, ensuring data consistency and compatibility across different versions.

## Directories and Their Contents

### `meta/`

This directory typically contains metadata about the migrations, such as a record of applied migrations, checksums, or other internal information used by the migration tool (e.g., Drizzle Kit) to track the state of the database schema.

## Individual Files and Their Functionality

### `0000_hot_the_fallen.sql`

This SQL file represents the first database migration. It contains SQL statements to create the initial database schema, including tables, columns, constraints, and indexes, as defined at the very beginning of the project.

### `0001_tricky_jackpot.sql`

This SQL file represents a subsequent database migration. It contains SQL statements to modify the existing database schema, such as adding new tables, altering existing tables (e.g., adding columns, changing data types), or creating new indexes. The naming convention (e.g., `0001_`) indicates the order in which migrations should be applied.
