# OpenCut Timeline Implementation Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of the OpenCut timeline system based on four core components: Timeline Track, Timeline Playhead, Timeline Index, and Timeline Element. This document outlines the architecture, patterns, and implementation strategy for understanding and potentially enhancing the timeline functionality.

## Component Architecture

### 1. Timeline Index (`index.tsx`) - Main Container
**Role**: Master orchestrator and layout manager

**Key Features**:
- Central state management via Zustand stores (`useTimelineStore`, `useMediaStore`, `usePlaybackStore`)
- Dynamic timeline width calculation based on duration and zoom level
- Drag-and-drop media handling with file processing
- Timeline toolbar integration (zoom controls, playback controls)
- Scroll synchronization between ruler and tracks
- Complex event handling for timeline interactions

**Core Pattern**:
```typescript
const dynamicTimelineWidth = Math.max(
  (duration || 0) * TIMELINE_CONSTANTS.PIXELS_PER_SECOND * zoomLevel,
  (currentTime + 30) * TIMELINE_CONSTANTS.PIXELS_PER_SECOND * zoomLevel,
  timelineRef.current?.clientWidth || 1000
);
```

### 2. Timeline Track (`timeline-track.tsx`) - Track Management
**Role**: Individual track rendering and element management

**Key Features**:
- Track-based element organization with type constraints
- Drag-and-drop functionality with snapping behavior
- Element positioning and collision detection
- Integration with timeline snapping hooks
- Complex state management for dragging operations

**Core Patterns**:
- Uses `useTimelineSnapping` hook for element alignment
- Implements `canElementGoOnTrack` validation logic
- Manages track sorting with `sortTracksByOrder`
- Handles main track creation with `ensureMainTrack`

### 3. Timeline Playhead (`timeline-playhead.tsx`) - Playback Control
**Role**: Visual playback indicator and seek control

**Key Features**:
- Real-time position tracking based on current time
- Interactive seeking with mouse interactions
- Synchronized scrolling across timeline views
- Dynamic height calculation based on track count
- Snapping indicator for playhead positioning

**Core Pattern**:
```typescript
const { playheadPosition, handlePlayheadMouseDown } = useTimelinePlayhead({
  currentTime,
  duration,
  zoomLevel,
  seek,
  rulerRef,
  rulerScrollRef,
  tracksScrollRef,
  playheadRef,
});
```

### 4. Timeline Element (`timeline-element.tsx`) - Media Representation
**Role**: Individual media element rendering and interaction

**Key Features**:
- Multi-media type support (video, audio, text)
- Context menu actions (cut, copy, split, delete)
- Visual feedback for selection states
- Resize handles for element duration adjustment
- Audio waveform visualization
- Type-specific rendering logic

**Core Patterns**:
- Uses `useTimelineElementResize` for element manipulation
- Implements context menu with `DropdownMenu` and `ContextMenu`
- Track-specific styling via `getTrackElementClasses`

## State Management Architecture

### Zustand Store Integration
1. **Timeline Store**: Core timeline state, tracks, elements, selection
2. **Media Store**: Media file management and metadata
3. **Playback Store**: Playback controls and current time
4. **Project Store**: Project-level data and persistence

### Key Constants
- `TIMELINE_CONSTANTS.PIXELS_PER_SECOND`: Base unit for time-to-pixel conversion
- Track height calculations via `getTrackHeight()`
- Snapping thresholds and grid alignment rules

## Advanced Features

### 1. Snapping System
- Frame-based snapping with `snapTimeToFrame`
- Element-to-element snapping
- Playhead snapping indicators
- Grid-based alignment

### 2. Drag-and-Drop Pipeline
- Media file validation and processing
- Track assignment logic
- Element positioning with collision detection
- Visual feedback during drag operations

### 3. Multi-Track Support
- Track type constraints (video, audio, text)
- Layered rendering with z-index management
- Track ordering and organization
- Main track handling for primary video content

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Hook-Based Logic Separation
- `useTimelinePlayhead`: Playhead behavior
- `useTimelineSnapping`: Element alignment
- `useTimelineElementResize`: Element manipulation
- Custom hooks for complex interactions

### 2. Type Safety
- Strong TypeScript typing for timeline elements
- Track type constraints
- Element validation patterns
- Interface definitions for props and state

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Dynamic rendering based on viewport
- Scroll synchronization optimization
- Element caching for smooth interactions
- Efficient re-rendering patterns

## Key Integration Points

### 1. FFmpeg Processing
- Media file processing pipeline
- Thumbnail generation for timeline previews
- Audio waveform extraction
- Video frame analysis

### 2. Canvas Rendering
- Real-time preview generation
- Element composition
- Export pipeline integration
- Performance optimization

### 3. File System Integration
- OPFS storage for large media files
- IndexedDB for metadata persistence
- Drag-and-drop file handling
- Browser-based file processing

## Development Considerations

### 1. Scalability
- Support for large numbers of elements
- Efficient track management
- Memory optimization for media handling
- Smooth performance at various zoom levels

### 2. User Experience
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interactions
- Visual feedback for all operations
- Keyboard shortcuts integration
- Responsive design considerations

### 3. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular component architecture
- Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- Consistent naming conventions

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Multi-Selection Support**: Batch operations on multiple elements
2. **Advanced Snapping**: Magnetic timeline with smart alignment
3. **Track Groups**: Logical grouping of related tracks
4. **Timeline Layers**: Composite track system for complex projects
5. **Performance Profiling**: Real-time performance monitoring
6. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
