Here’s what I gathered from task4.md and the surrounding context.
Problem recap
The exported file is far longer than the ~10 s timeline.
Root cause: our render loop stalls for ≈500-700 ms every frame while we await seekVideoToTime, yet MediaRecorder keeps recording in real time. That stretches the final video.
Proposed architectural fix inside task4.md
Abandon real-time MediaRecorder.
Render each frame off-line, capture the canvas as an image, then feed all images (plus audio later) to FFmpeg in the browser to produce the final video.
This completely decouples “slow-but-exact rendering” from “encoding”, guaranteeing the duration is exactly (frameCount / fps).
Implementation attempt written in the file
A brand-new FFmpeg-based VideoRecorder class (stores PNG frames, then calls ffmpeg.exec -i frame-%05d.png …).
ExportEngine was gutted and rewritten to:
preload videos,
sequentially loop through every frame (no requestAnimationFrame),
call renderer.toDataURL() after drawing,
push the PNG into VideoRecorder.addFrame,
finally call VideoRecorder.stop() to encode.
Why this draft is not yet ready to run
Large diff pasted but not applied to the repo (the tools never executed an edit_file).
@ffmpeg/ffmpeg and @ffmpeg/util are referenced but not yet installed / imported in the project.
FFmpeg.writeFile / readFile expect Uint8Array; we need to poly-fill fetch/Blob in Node or run in browser-side worker.
Audio path is now commented out.
FrameCaptureService.getFrameData(i) still returns all elements; we must pass the filtered list (currently it does after the earlier fix).
Error-handling, memory limits (thousands of PNGs) and progress callbacks need polish.
Webpack / Next bundling must be configured to allow dynamic import("@ffmpeg/ffmpeg") (it’s an ESM-only package).
Conclusion & recommended next steps
A. Break the change into incremental PR-sized edits:
Add the FFmpeg dependency and a minimal wrapper that can encode 2-3 dummy PNGs to MP4.
Create the new VideoRecorder class in isolation with unit tests.
Wire ExportEngine to use VideoRecorder, but keep the old MediaRecorder behind a feature flag so we don’t break existing exports until the new path is stable.
Add a memory-guard (e.g. stop if frames × (width × height × 4) > N MB).
Add optional audio muxing (once video path is solid).
B. Verify browser support – FFmpeg-wasm works but needs >150 MB memory; Safari requires "crossOriginIsolated" headers.
C. If FFmpeg-wasm proves too heavy, fall back to a server-side encode or a streaming “pipe” using MediaStreamTrackGenerator (but that re-introduces timing issues).
Let me know which step you’d like tackled first (e.g. “make a minimal FFmpeg encoder that turns 3 canvas snapshots into an MP4”), and I’ll implement it incrementally and test it rather than pasting a full-file replacement.
