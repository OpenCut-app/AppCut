# Task 23: Electron Resource Loading Failures - Todo List

## Overview
Critical resource loading breakdown in Electron app preventing proper initialization:
1. **16 Failed Resource Loads** - All static assets returning `net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`
2. **React/ReactDOM undefined** - Preventing app hydration and functionality
3. **Complete UI failure** - Images, CSS, and JavaScript not loading
4. **Root cause**: Static file serving mechanism is broken despite syntax error fix

## Console Error Summary
```
‚ùå 16 Critical Resource Failures:
- CSS: 60c5d6bffb61bd3e.css
- Fonts: e4af272ccee01ff0-s.p.woff2  
- Core JS: webpack, framework, main, _app
- Chunks: 415, 588, 590, index, _buildManifest, _ssgManifest
- Images: logo.svg, landing-page-bg.png

‚úÖ Working Elements:
- Electron preload script loads
- Location patch prepared
- DOM ready events fire
- ElectronAPI detected
```

## Todo Tasks

### üö® **CRITICAL: Fix Core Resource Loading (18 min total)**

#### Task 1.1: Investigate file path resolution (3 min)
- [ ] Check current working directory in Electron main process
- [ ] Verify `out` directory structure and file locations
- [ ] Test if files exist at expected paths

#### Task 1.2: Debug protocol handler (3 min) 
- [ ] Check if `file://` or `app://` protocol is being used
- [ ] Verify protocol handler is correctly registered
- [ ] Test direct file access via absolute paths

#### Task 1.3: Analyze HTML file paths (3 min)
- [ ] Read `apps/web/out/index.html` and check resource URLs
- [ ] Compare actual file locations vs requested URLs
- [ ] Identify path transformation issues

#### Task 1.4: Test resource loading mechanism (3 min)
- [ ] Check Electron network tab for request details
- [ ] Verify if requests are reaching protocol handler
- [ ] Identify where requests are failing (browser vs handler)

#### Task 1.5: Fix path resolution strategy (3 min)
- [ ] Update Electron main process file serving logic
- [ ] Ensure correct base path for static files
- [ ] Test with one critical file (e.g., CSS)

#### Task 1.6: Verify core fix (3 min)
- [ ] Run Electron app after path fixes
- [ ] Check if CSS and core JavaScript load
- [ ] Confirm reduced error count in console

### üî¥ **HIGH PRIORITY: Fix JavaScript Loading (15 min total)**

#### Task 2.1: Investigate webpack chunk loading (3 min)
- [ ] Check webpack configuration in built files
- [ ] Verify chunk path resolution in `webpack-*.js`
- [ ] Test if webpack public path is correct

#### Task 2.2: Debug framework loading (3 min)
- [ ] Check `framework-*.js` file loading
- [ ] Verify React/ReactDOM are in framework chunk
- [ ] Test direct file access to framework file

#### Task 2.3: Fix main app script loading (3 min)
- [ ] Debug `main-*.js` and `_app-*.js` loading
- [ ] Check script loading order in HTML
- [ ] Verify dependencies are loading before app code

#### Task 2.4: Test React availability (3 min)
- [ ] Add debug script to check React after each successful load
- [ ] Verify React and ReactDOM become available
- [ ] Check if Next.js starts initializing

#### Task 2.5: Verify app hydration (3 min)
- [ ] Test if React components become interactive
- [ ] Check if routing and navigation work
- [ ] Confirm app is fully functional

### üü° **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Fix UI Assets (12 min total)**

#### Task 3.1: Debug CSS loading (3 min)
- [ ] Check CSS file path in HTML vs actual location
- [ ] Test if CSS loads after core path fixes
- [ ] Verify styling applies correctly

#### Task 3.2: Fix font resource loading (3 min)
- [ ] Locate font file in `out/_next/static/media/`
- [ ] Check font preload links in HTML
- [ ] Test font loading with correct paths

#### Task 3.3: Debug image loading (3 min)
- [ ] Check image paths in HTML (logo.svg, landing-page-bg.png)
- [ ] Verify images exist in correct output locations
- [ ] Test image loading after path fixes

#### Task 3.4: Verify complete UI (3 min)
- [ ] Test that all visual elements render correctly
- [ ] Check that fonts, images, and styling work
- [ ] Confirm UI matches expected appearance

### üü¢ **LOW PRIORITY: Cleanup and Security (9 min total)**

#### Task 4.1: Review build manifest loading (3 min)
- [ ] Debug `_buildManifest.js` and `_ssgManifest.js` loading
- [ ] Check if these are critical for app function
- [ ] Test if app works without these files

#### Task 4.2: Address security warnings (3 min)
- [ ] Review Electron security configuration
- [ ] Consider if webSecurity should be enabled for production
- [ ] Document security implications for current setup

#### Task 4.3: Final integration test (3 min)
- [ ] Run complete end-to-end test of Electron app
- [ ] Verify all functionality works as expected
- [ ] Document any remaining minor issues

## Testing Checklist

### After Each Phase:
- [ ] Electron app starts without crashes
- [ ] Console error count decreases
- [ ] Core functionality becomes available
- [ ] UI elements progressively appear

### Final Verification:
- [ ] **Zero** `net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` errors
- [ ] React and ReactDOM are defined and functional
- [ ] All UI elements render correctly (text, images, styling)
- [ ] Navigation and interaction work properly
- [ ] App behaves identically to browser version

## Root Cause Hypotheses

### Most Likely Causes:
1. **Base Path Issue**: Electron serving from wrong directory
2. **Protocol Misconfiguration**: `file://` vs `app://` protocol confusion  
3. **Path Transform Failure**: Build script didn't correctly update paths
4. **Relative Path Resolution**: Paths resolving relative to wrong base

### Investigation Strategy:
1. **File System Check**: Verify files exist where expected
2. **Network Analysis**: Check actual vs expected request URLs
3. **Protocol Debug**: Test protocol handler registration and function
4. **Build Output Review**: Compare build script output vs actual files

## Notes
- **Priority**: Fix resource loading first - everything else depends on this
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.x must complete before Task 2.x can succeed
- **Time Estimate**: 54 minutes total if all tasks needed
- **Success Criteria**: Electron app fully functional with zero resource loading errors

---
**Status**: Ready to start with Task 1.1 - File path investigation
**Goal**: Transform 16 failed resource loads into 0 errors and full functionality
