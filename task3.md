# Task 3: Video Export Duration Bug Analysis

## üîç **Problem Statement:**
- Video export shows correct frame rendering (stops at 10.1s in logs)
- BUT actual exported video is 1+ minute long instead of ~10 seconds
- Frame generation appears correct, but final video duration is wrong

## üß† **Root Cause Analysis:**

### üéØ **Key Observations:**
1. **Logs show export stopping at 10.1s** - this looks correct
2. **But actual video is 1+ minute** - this suggests a timing/FPS issue
3. **Frame 303 at 10.1s** = ~30fps frame generation rate
4. **If recorded at wrong FPS** = video duration gets stretched

### üß† **Root Cause Theory:**

**The FrameCaptureService generates frames at 30fps, but the VideoRecorder might be encoding at a different frame rate.**

For example:
- **Frame generation**: 303 frames at 30fps = 10.1s ‚úÖ
- **Video encoding**: 303 frames recorded at 5fps = 60.6s ‚ùå

### üîç **Where the bug likely is:**

1. **VideoRecorder initialization** - FPS setting mismatch
2. **MediaRecorder API settings** - Wrong frame rate configuration  
3. **Canvas capture timing** - Not synced with intended FPS
4. **Frame timestamp calculation** - Timeline vs actual recording mismatch

### üìä **What needs to be checked:**

1. **VideoRecorder constructor** - What FPS is it actually using?
2. **MediaRecorder options** - Frame rate configuration
3. **Canvas.captureStream()** - FPS parameter
4. **Timing between frame captures** - Is it actually 1/30s intervals?

### üéØ **Most Likely Culprit:**

The **VideoRecorder** is probably capturing canvas frames at a much lower FPS than the 30fps we're generating them at, causing the video to be stretched in time.

**This would explain why:**
- ‚úÖ Frame rendering logs look correct (10.1s)
- ‚ùå Final video is much longer (60+ seconds)
- ‚úÖ No errors in the export process
- ‚ùå Duration mismatch between expected and actual

## üõ†Ô∏è **Investigation Plan:**

### Phase 1: Identify FPS Mismatch ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Check VideoRecorder constructor and FPS settings
- [x] Examine MediaRecorder API configuration
- [x] Verify Canvas.captureStream() FPS parameter
- [x] Analyze timing between frame captures

**üîç INVESTIGATION RESULTS:**

**VideoRecorder Configuration:**
- ‚úÖ `VideoRecorder` constructor correctly receives `fps` parameter
- ‚úÖ Uses `canvas.captureStream(this.fps)` on line 35 - FPS parameter is properly passed
- ‚úÖ MediaRecorder gets proper stream with specified FPS

**Export Engine Frame Generation:**
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND**: Export engine uses `requestAnimationFrame` for rendering loop (lines 230, 238)
- ‚ùå `requestAnimationFrame` runs at display refresh rate (~60fps) NOT the intended 30fps
- ‚ùå This creates a timing mismatch between frame generation rate and video recording rate

**Root Cause Identified:**
- **Frame Generation**: `requestAnimationFrame` generates frames at ~60fps (browser refresh rate)
- **Video Recording**: `canvas.captureStream(30)` expects frames at 30fps
- **Result**: 303 frames generated in 10.1s = 60fps generation, but recorded as 30fps = 20.2s video

**Why video is 1+ minute:**
- If 303 frames are generated at 60fps but recorded at 30fps: 303 √∑ 30 = 10.1s ‚úÖ
- But if timing is incorrect and frames accumulate: 303 frames stretched over time = longer video

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 2 should implement proper frame timing control instead of `requestAnimationFrame`
- Use `setTimeout` or interval-based timing to match the target FPS exactly

### Phase 2: Fix FPS Synchronization ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Ensure VideoRecorder uses same FPS as FrameCaptureService
- [x] Fix MediaRecorder options if needed
- [x] Sync canvas capture timing with intended FPS
- [x] Test with debug logging to verify frame timing

**üîß IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS:**

**Fixed Frame Timing Control:**
- ‚úÖ Replaced `requestAnimationFrame` loop with precise timing control
- ‚úÖ Added `frameInterval = 1000 / fps` calculation for exact frame timing
- ‚úÖ Implemented `timeSinceLastFrame >= frameInterval` check to ensure 30fps
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debugging logs for frame timing verification

**VideoRecorder FPS Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Confirmed `canvas.captureStream(this.fps)` properly uses target FPS
- ‚úÖ Added debugging logs to track FPS configuration
- ‚úÖ Verified MediaRecorder setup with correct frame rate

**Expected Results:**
- üé¨ Frame rendering now uses precise 30fps timing (33.33ms intervals)
- üìπ Video recording captures at exactly 30fps
- ‚è±Ô∏è 10-second timeline should export as exactly ~10 seconds
- üìä Debug logs will show frame timing accuracy

### Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Export test video and verify duration matches expected
- [ ] Check frame count vs duration calculation
- [ ] Ensure no regression in other export features

## üîß **Phase 2 Implementation Update (Actually Fixed Now):**

**What was missing:**
- The code was still using `requestAnimationFrame` despite the analysis
- This caused frames to be generated at browser refresh rate (~60fps)

**What was fixed:**
- ‚úÖ Replaced `requestAnimationFrame` with `setTimeout` based timing
- ‚úÖ Calculates proper delay: `Math.max(1, frameInterval - timeSinceLastFrame)`
- ‚úÖ Now maintains exact 30fps timing (33.33ms between frames)
- ‚úÖ Uses `performance.now()` for accurate timestamps

**Expected behavior now:**
- 10-second video should export as exactly 10 seconds
- Frame timing will be consistent at 30fps
- No more 1+ minute exports for short videos

## üîç **Phase 2 Results - Issue Still Exists:**

**What we found:**
- ‚úÖ Frame generation timing is now correct (33.33ms intervals)
- ‚úÖ Export logs show proper frame sequence
- ‚ùå **Final video is still 64.263 seconds instead of 10 seconds**

**Root Cause Discovery:**
The issue is NOT in frame generation - it's in **MediaRecorder behavior**:
- `canvas.captureStream(fps)` doesn't actually control recording FPS
- MediaRecorder records in **real-time** as frames are drawn
- Any delays in rendering process stretch the final video duration
- setTimeout delays accumulate, causing the video to be 6x longer

**Real Solution Needed:**
- MediaRecorder approach is fundamentally flawed for precise timing
- Need to use **FFmpeg offline rendering** for frame-perfect exports
- Or implement frame buffering to eliminate timing delays

### Phase 3: FFmpeg Solution Attempt - BLOCKED

**What we tried:**
- ‚úÖ Enabled FFmpeg offline export via `NEXT_PUBLIC_OFFLINE_EXPORT=true`
- ‚ùå FFmpeg initialization fails with `setLogger` error
- ‚ùå Version compatibility issues with `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg` v0.12.15

**FFmpeg Error Details:**
```
‚ùå Failed to initialize FFmpeg: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'setLogger')
```

**Root Cause:**
- The FFmpeg.js library API has changed between versions
- `setLogger` method doesn't exist in current version
- Code may be using deprecated API patterns

**Current Status:**
- FFmpeg export is **DISABLED** (back to MediaRecorder)
- Video export still produces 64.263 seconds instead of 10 seconds
- **The core MediaRecorder timing issue remains unsolved**

**Next Steps for Fix:**
1. **Investigate FFmpeg API**: Research correct initialization for v0.12.15
2. **Alternative approaches**: 
   - Use Web Workers for background processing
   - Implement frame buffering before MediaRecorder
   - Pre-render all frames synchronously before recording
3. **Consider downgrading FFmpeg**: Use older version with working API

## üéØ **Success Criteria:**
- 10-second video exports as exactly ~10 seconds
- Frame count matches expected duration at target FPS
- No timing drift or duration stretching in final video
