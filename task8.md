# Task 8: Auto-Media Integration & AI Enhancement

## Overview
Complete the AI video generation workflow by implementing automatic media region integration and enhancing the user experience. Focus on seamless video-to-media flow and advanced features.

## Priority: Auto-Media Integration (URGENT)
**Current Issue**: Generated videos don't automatically appear in the media panel - user has to manually click "Add to Timeline"

## Phase 1: Auto-Media Integration (12 minutes total)

### 1.1 Fix Auto-Media Store Integration (3 min)
- [ ] Investigate why videos don't auto-appear in media panel
- [ ] Check media-store integration in ai.tsx handleGenerate function
- [ ] Fix automatic video addition to media store on generation completion

### 1.2 Add Auto-Preview in Media Panel (3 min)
- [ ] Ensure generated videos automatically show in Media tab
- [ ] Add proper thumbnail generation for video preview
- [ ] Test media panel refresh after video generation

### 1.3 Improve Status Polling (3 min)
- [ ] Add real-time polling for video generation status
- [ ] Show progress updates in UI during generation
- [ ] Auto-refresh media panel when video completes

### 1.4 Test Auto-Integration Flow (3 min)
- [ ] Generate video and verify it appears in media panel automatically
- [ ] Test drag-and-drop from media panel to timeline
- [ ] Verify video metadata is preserved

## Phase 2: User Experience Enhancements (15 minutes total)

### 2.1 Add Cost Estimation (3 min)
- [ ] Calculate cost based on model selection
- [ ] Display estimated cost before generation
- [ ] Add warning for expensive models

### 2.2 Add Prompt Suggestions (3 min)
- [ ] Create predefined prompt templates
- [ ] Add dropdown or buttons for quick selection
- [ ] Categories: Nature, Urban, Abstract, etc.

### 2.3 Add Generation Settings (3 min)
- [ ] Add duration slider (model-dependent)
- [ ] Add resolution selector
- [ ] Add aspect ratio options

### 2.4 Improve UI Polish (3 min)
- [ ] Add proper styling and spacing
- [ ] Add icons and visual feedback
- [ ] Test responsive design

### 2.5 Add Real-Time Progress (3 min)
- [ ] Show progress during generation
- [ ] Add estimated time remaining
- [ ] Allow cancellation of generation

## Phase 3: Error Handling & Robustness (15 minutes total)

### 3.1 Add API Error Handling (3 min)
- [ ] Handle API key errors
- [ ] Handle quota exceeded errors
- [ ] Handle network timeout errors

### 3.2 Add Input Validation (3 min)
- [ ] Validate prompt length and content
- [ ] Validate model selection
- [ ] Show validation errors to user

### 3.3 Add Retry Logic (3 min)
- [ ] Implement retry for failed generations
- [ ] Add exponential backoff
- [ ] Limit retry attempts

### 3.4 Add Loading States (3 min)
- [ ] Improve loading spinner and messages
- [ ] Add generation queue management
- [ ] Show multiple video generation status

### 3.5 Test Error Scenarios (3 min)
- [ ] Test with invalid API key
- [ ] Test with network disconnection
- [ ] Test with invalid prompts

## Phase 4: Production Readiness (15 minutes total)

### 4.1 Add Environment Configuration (3 min)
- [ ] Add production API URL config
- [ ] Add development/production toggles
- [ ] Configure CORS settings properly

### 4.2 Add Logging and Monitoring (3 min)
- [ ] Add console logging for debugging
- [ ] Log generation requests and responses
- [ ] Add error tracking

### 4.3 Add Rate Limiting (3 min)
- [ ] Implement client-side rate limiting
- [ ] Add cooldown between generations
- [ ] Show rate limit warnings

### 4.4 Add Security Headers (3 min)
- [ ] Add API key validation
- [ ] Add request authentication
- [ ] Sanitize user inputs

### 4.5 Final Testing (3 min)
- [ ] Test complete user workflow
- [ ] Verify all features work together
- [ ] Check for memory leaks

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Generated videos automatically appear in media panel
- [ ] Smooth drag-and-drop from media to timeline
- [ ] Real-time progress updates during generation
- [ ] Cost estimation displayed before generation
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Production-ready configuration

## Quick Debug Commands
```bash
# Check if media store integration working
# Look for addMediaItem calls in browser dev tools
# Verify video files are saved to OPFS properly

# Start AI service for testing
cd services/ai-video-generator
source venv/bin/activate && source .env && python main.py

# Test video generation
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"Test video","model":"hailuo","duration":5}' \
  http://localhost:8000/generate-video
```

## Notes
- Focus on Phase 1 first - auto-media integration is the most critical missing piece
- Video generation backend is fully working, issue is in frontend integration
- Generated videos currently require manual "Add to Timeline" click
- Need to investigate media-store.ts integration in the AI component

## Total Estimated Time: 57 minutes (under 1 hour)
**Priority: Start with Phase 1 to fix auto-media integration**
